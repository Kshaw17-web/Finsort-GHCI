FinSort Demo Script (60-90 seconds)

[INTRO - 10 seconds]
"FinSort is a local transaction categorization system that automatically classifies bank transactions into categories like Groceries, Food & Dining, and Shopping. Let me show you how it works."

[DEMO 1 - CLI/Streamlit Prediction - 20 seconds]
"Here's a transaction: 'SQ *COFFEE-SPOT 123'. The model predicts it as 'coffee_shop' with 43% confidence, mapped to 'Food & Dining'. 

Let me try another: 'AMAZON MKTPLACE PMTS' predicts 'ecommerce' with 88% confidence, mapped to 'Shopping'. 

Notice the explanation tokens show which words contributed most to the prediction - 'amazon' and 'marketplace' in this case."

[DEMO 2 - Config Remapping - 15 seconds]
"One powerful feature is that you can remap categories without retraining. 

I'll edit finsort/config.json and change 'ecommerce' from 'Shopping' to 'Online Retail'. 

Now when I run the same prediction, 'AMAZON MKTPLACE PMTS' maps to 'Online Retail' instead. The underlying model tag stays the same, but the category mapping changes instantly - no retraining needed!"

[DEMO 3 - Feedback Correction - 15 seconds]
"Sometimes predictions have low confidence. When that happens, users can submit corrections. 

For example, if a low-confidence prediction is wrong, I can enter the correct category here. The correction is automatically logged to finsort/feedback.log, which can be used later to improve the model."

[METRICS & REPO - 20 seconds]
"FinSort achieves a macro F1 score of 1.00 on the test set, with strong performance across all 10 categories.

The repo structure is clean: 
- The finsort package contains the core logic
- Training data and scripts are in the root
- We have both a CLI demo and a Streamlit web UI
- Tests ensure code quality
- The config.json file makes category remapping simple

That's FinSort - local, fast, and configurable transaction categorization!"
